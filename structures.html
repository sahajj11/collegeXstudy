    <div class="theory">
        <p>Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) is a fundamental concept in computer science and programming. It refers to the study of how data is organized and manipulated, as well as the development and analysis of efficient algorithms for solving various computational problems. Here's a brief overview of each:<br></p>

            <p>-Data Structures: Data structures are ways to organize and store data so that it can be efficiently accessed and manipulated. Common data structures include arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, graphs, and hash tables. The choice of a data structure depends on the specific problem you're trying to solve and the operations you need to perform on the data.<br></p>
            
            <p>-Algorithms: Algorithms are step-by-step procedures or sets of rules for performing a specific task or solving a particular problem. They are the heart of computer programs and determine how efficiently a task can be completed. The design and analysis of algorithms aim to find the most efficient way to solve problems and manipulate data.<br></p>
            
            <p>-DSA is essential for all levels of software development, from writing simple scripts to building complex applications and systems. By understanding and applying data structures and algorithms effectively, programmers can optimize their code for performance and solve a wide range of problems efficiently. It's a critical part of computer science education and is used in various fields, including software development, artificial intelligence, database management, and more.</p>
